								<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
								<p>The Museum of the Computer Keyboard explores the evolution of the typewriters, it’s relationship with the the computer keyboard, and the many layouts and designs invented in the past and present for technology enthusiasts.</p>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon solid fa-male">
									<h3>Charles Latham Sholes</h3>
									<p>Born February 14, 1819, Sholes is the man who invented the modern keyboard and the QWERTY Layout June 23, 1868. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-keyboard">
									<h3>QWERTY Layout</h3>
									<p>The QWERTY layout is widely used today, pre-loaded onto many devices. It is known as the "Universal Keyboard".</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-laptop">
									<h3>Computer Keyboard</h3>
									<p>As advancement in technology continued, the Typewriter followed. The Typewriter's layout was used on classic computers and was once able to be converted into a computer keyboard. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-mobile">
									<h3>Virtual Keyboards</h3>
									<p>With the ivention of touchscreens and want for space-saving minimalism, inventors designed a virtual keyboard to be used on the touchscreens of mobile devices.</p>

									<h3>1714</h3>
									<p>The first person to think and patent anything close to a Typwriter was Henry Mill who vaguely patents "Writing Machine" in January 7, 1714.</p>

									<h3>1808</h3>
									<p>The first person to actually invent something that could have been similar to the Typewriter was Italian Pellegrino Turri in 1808, who made a typwriter-like machine for his blind lady friend; although we do not have any physical evidence of the machine itself, there are letters that survived. There is even a book about the story called <i>The Blind Contessa's New Machine</i> by Carey Wallace</p>

										<h3>1868</h3>
									<p>The Hansen Writing Ball’s was finalized in 1868 and is referred to the first real typewriter because it is the closest evidence to something very close. It has a keyboard and types letters. The only problem might have been the aesthetic and ergonomics.</p>

									<h3>1873 - 1878</h3>
									<p>Christopher Latham Sholes invents the Modern Mechanical keyboard in 1873 and although it didn't hit record sales as expected, the weapon manufacturing company, Remington Company, worked with the Sholes and James Denmore to manufacture and advertise it as the Remington Typewriter. Sholes and Denmore patent the typewriter and the QWERTY layout used on it.</p>

									<h3>1925</h3>
									<p>The Typewriter was improving with more and more manufactures making them, but there were still other inventors looking to make other typing machines. The Morkrum Printing Telegraph was patented in 1904 by Charles Krum and in 1908, the first working Telegraph was made. Morkrum Printing Telegraph was later sold commercially in 1910. They grew in success over time and were at their peak in 1925.</p>

									<h3>1946 - 1948</h3>
									<p>EINAC Computer was the very first computer and it is still the biggest technological advancement next to the internet. It was made in 1946 and used telegraph technology to work with punchcards that would input data into the computer and it would then output data. In 1948, the BINAC Computer was made and thet used magnets instead of punching holes into paper. This led to the invention of magnetic typewriters.</p>
